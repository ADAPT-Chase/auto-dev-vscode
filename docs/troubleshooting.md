For debugging purposes, you can open the developer tools by clicking on `Help -> Toggle Developer Tools` in the main
menu.

For example:

```bash
An error occurred during model execution: "TypeError: Tensor.data must be a typed array for numeric tensor.".
```

This error occurs when the model is not loaded properly.

Then you can copy the error message and paste it into
the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/unit-mesh/auto-dev-vscode/issues/new/choose) to get help from the AutoDev team.
